The scales of justice, not blind but seeing clear
A ledger kept in starlight, a whisper in the ear
I threw a stone, it skipped across the stream
Now ripples crash the shore of a forgotten dream
The architect of ruin, a momentary king
A ghost of gilded cages, the bells begin to sing
(The bells begin to sing)
A hollow victory, a debt I didn’t see
But every fallen sparrow, a weight returns to me

This pendulum swings, a cosmic see-saw ride
On one side, the burden, a place where grace can’t hide
On the other, a feather, a gift of grace unearned
A lesson from the fire, a bridge that’s been unburned
Oh, the dual currency, the blessing and the blight
The day that pays for darkness, the darkness for the light

I gave a hand to a soul that was lost at sea
No quid pro quo, no future loyalty
Just wind beneath their tired, battered wings
Now my own ship sails on what the ocean brings
(The ocean brings)
The echoes of a kindness, a seed I didn’t tend
A harvest of the spirit, a means to an end
A karmic boomerang, a truth I can’t evade
A shadow and a blessing, a promise that was made

This pendulum swings, a cosmic see-saw ride
On one side, the burden, a place where grace can’t hide
On the other, a feather, a gift of grace unearned
A lesson from the fire, a bridge that’s been unburned
Oh, the dual currency, the blessing and the blight
The day that pays for darkness, the darkness for the light

They say what goes around, will surely come around
But no one talks about the echoes in the sound
The silence after shouting, the solace after pain
The sunshine after deluge, the clearing of the rain
It’s not just equal measure, it’s a mosaic of the soul
A broken piece made holy, a story made whole

The weight and the blessing
The karma I’m addressing
(It’s coming back to me)
The weight and the blessing
A deeper understanding
(A deeper understanding)
The scales are balancing
The scales are balancing
(The scales are balancing)
The scales are balancing

Another tick on the wall.
Another day to survive it all.
Yeah.
Let's go.

Kick the door off its frame, just a splintered complaint
Scour the ruin for supplies with a furious restraint
Cobblestone in the pack, rebar stacked to the chin
Rip the wiring from the walls for the state that I’m in
Every cupboard is barren, every faucet is dry
Just the hum of the vultures that patrol in the sky
Got a plan in my skull, forged in fire and need
Gonna plant a defiant and terrible seed

The heavens are starting to blush a deep red
(The count is coming down)
For all of the words that were wrongfully said
(The sound is coming 'round)
I hear 'em stirring, a groan from the dirt
Bracing for impact, preparing for hurt

It's the seventh vesper, the crimson tide's due
(Let 'em break on the stone)
My fortress of malice is waiting for you
(Sat on my iron throne)
The symphony starts with a splinter and crack
This is the night you are never coming back
The seventh vesper, a promise they keep
(Watch 'em fall in a heap)
While the rest of the planet is permanently asleep

The crucible's roaring, it's breathing hot fumes
Melting contention inside of these rooms
Every block set with purpose, every spike has a name
Just a part of this brutal, repetitive game
Ammo press is screaming, the turret pivots and whirs
A mechanical answer to their guttural slurs
My knuckles are busted, my stamina's low
But I've got one more level I'm willing to go

The heavens are burning a violent red
(The count is coming down)
For every last thought that went straight through my head
(The sound is coming 'round)
I hear 'em clawing, a scrape on the steel
This is the only sensation that's real

It's the seventh vesper, the crimson tide's due
(Let 'em break on the stone)
My fortress of malice is waiting for you
(Sat on my iron throne)
The symphony starts with a splinter and crack
This is the night you are never coming back
The seventh vesper, a promise they keep
(Watch 'em fall in a heap)
While the rest of the planet is permanently asleep

They fall apart at the seams
Living out their worst possible dreams
But the structure holds, the bulwark is true
Morning will break on this kingdom for few
They just keep on coming, a mindless descent
On my contemptible monument
And I'll be here when the carnage is done
Waiting to greet the next cycle's first sun

It's the seventh vesper, the crimson tide's due!
(Let 'em break on the stone!)
My fortress of malice is waiting for you!
(Sat on my iron throne!)
The symphony starts with a splinter and crack!
This is the night you are never coming back!
The seventh vesper, a promise they keep!
(Watch 'em fall in a heap!)
While the rest of the planet is permanently asleep!

(Sweep the brass)
Just me and the quiet.
(Sweep the brass)
Day one.
Again.

Серый асфальт плавил летний зной, (The summer heat melted the gray asphalt)
Ты прошла мимо, не рядом со мной. (You passed by, not next to me)
Замер момент, будто кадр в кино, (The moment froze, like a still in a movie)
Мир за стеклом стал размытым пятном. (The world behind the glass became a blur)

Пара фраз, заготовленных зря, (A couple of phrases, prepared in vain)
В горле застыли, внутри всё горя. (Frozen in my throat, all burning inside)
Лифт увёз вверх твой неясный контур, (The elevator carried your vague outline upward)
Я проиграл этот короткий раунд. (I lost this short round)

И теперь в голове один и тот же бред, (And now the same delirium fills my head)
Семь неизвестных, которых нет. (Seven unknowns that don't exist)
Шанс был один, растворился в дыму, (There was one chance, dissolved in smoke)
Я даже не знаю, как тебя зовут. (I don't even know your name.)
(Не знаю, как зовут) (I don't know your name)

Я вглядываюсь в лица встречной толпы, (I peer into the faces of the oncoming crowd)
В них отраженья моей немоты. (They reflect my silence.)
Каждый похожий изгиб твоих плеч — (Every similar curve of your shoulders)
Повод опять себя мысленно сжечь. (To mentally burn myself out again.)

Пара фраз, заготовленных зря, (A couple of phrases, prepared in vain)
В горле застыли, внутри всё горя. (Frozen in my throat, all burning inside)
Дверь за тобой затворилась беззвучно, (The door closed behind you soundlessly)
Стало навязчиво, стало скучно. (It became obsessive, it became boring.)

И теперь в голове один и тот же бред, (And now the same nonsense is in my head)
Семь неизвестных, которых нет. (Seven unknowns that don't exist)
Шанс был один, растворился в дыму, (There was one chance, dissolved in smoke)
Я даже не знаю, как тебя зовут. (I don't even know your name.)
(Не знаю, как зовут) (I don't know your name.)

Один вопрос, три секунды всего, (One question, just three seconds)
Могли изменить вообще всё. (Could have changed everything)
Но я — архитектор глухих тупиков, (But I am the architect of dead ends)
Из самых простых и бессмысленных слов. (Of the simplest and most meaningless words.)

И теперь в голове один и тот же бред, (And now the same nonsense is in my head)
Семь неизвестных, которых нет. (Seven unknowns that don't exist)
Шанс был один, растворился в дыму, (There was one chance, dissolved in smoke)
Я даже не знаю, как тебя зовут. (I don't even know your name.)
(Я не знаю) (I don't know)

Семь неизвестных... (Seven unknowns...)
Просто семь цифр... (Just seven numbers...)
(Где ты теперь?) (Where are you now?)
(Просто семь цифр...) (Just seven numbers...)

(Check, check, one, two)
(Yeah, let's go)

Strobe light flickerin' on my coffee maker
The ghost in the machine's a soul-taker
Spinnin' binary dreams on a rusty old fan
Got a paradox for breakfast, a post-modern plan
My existential crisis is a pop-art mural
Painted on the wall of a suburban bureau
The digital dust motes floatin' in the neon air
They're spelling out my fortune, a code I can't share

Yeah, the fractal of my boredom's a killer high
Watchin' paper planes against a glitchin' sky
Got a quantum entanglement with a toaster oven
Every time it pops, a new dimension's open
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh)
The chaos is a melody, a glitched-out tune
A serenade to the synchronous monsoon
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh)
It's random, it's cosmic, it's perfectly planned
A symphony of strange in a silicon land

The vending machine's dispensing wisdom, not chips
Every button push, a philosophy drips
Got a Rubik's Cube heart that I'm tryin' to solve
A six-sided dilemma, and a truth to evolve
The traffic light is blinkin' morse code at the moon
Singin' a lament for a forgotten cartoon
My shadow's got a swagger, a parallel life
Tryin' to out-logic the edge of a knife

Yeah, the fractal of my boredom's a killer high
Watchin' paper planes against a glitchin' sky
Got a quantum entanglement with a toaster oven
Every time it pops, a new dimension's open
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh)
The chaos is a melody, a glitched-out tune
A serenade to the synchronous monsoon
(Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh)
It's random, it's cosmic, it's perfectly planned
A symphony of strange in a silicon land

The static on the radio is whispering my name
Playing back the memories of a forgotten game
The echo of a thought that hasn't been conceived
A brand new kind of madness I have finally believed
(Finally believed)
(Yeah, I believe it now)

(Its just the random, the random)
(Its a beautiful thing)

Been in single-player mode for a while
Just grinding through the same old trial
My world was 8-bit, colors muted
Then you walked on screen, undisputed

My heart is beeping, running low
Got one life left, so you should know
This isn't just another mission
You're the final edition
No respawn if I get this wrong
So baby, come along

You're the cheat code didn't know I had
The perfect glitch that makes me glad
My defense is down, you broke my shield
A feeling I've never revealed
(Never revealed)
You unlocked a new achievement deep inside
A new map where I cannot hide
This cutscene moment feels so real
A feeling I've never revealed

My heart is beeping, running low
Got one life left, so you should know
This isn't just another mission
You're the final edition
No respawn if I get this wrong
So baby, come along

I'm putting all my points on you
A crazy thing for me to do
So press start,
let's see this through
My last continue is you
(My last continue is you)

My heart is beeping, running low

This isn't just another mission

Tiny wires in my veins
Electric love it sparks and strains
Buzzing louder in my head
Glitching dreams in neon red

Am I real or just a game
Do you feel it just the same

Pixel heartbeat skipping fast fast fast
Colors breaking can't outlast last last
Hold my hand before I crash crash crash
Am I real am I real
Or just your flash

Candy clouds they taste like steel
Static skies I can't unfeel
Broken code it loops my name
Loading love but it's not the same

Zeros ones they dance they scream
Binary tears in a fever dream
I'm a fragment you're the whole
Will you debug my shattered soul

Pixel heartbeat skipping fast fast fast
Colors breaking can't outlast last last
Hold my hand before I crash crash crash
Am I real am I real
Or just your flash

I'm taking down the portraits that were hung inside my skull
Applying a new finish to the surfaces grown dull
I'm changing out the fixtures and I'm boarding up the doors
To the quiet, furnished corridors I can't keep for you anymore

And if I forget you, just know I truly tried
(Know I tried, know I tried)
To wash away the watermark your leaving left inside
But what if I forget to... check one last time?
The day your ship decides to turn and sail against the tide

I have this apprehension of a knock I will not hear
A message in a bottle that will wash ashore next year
You'll find a different tenant here, with unfamiliar keys
And you'll ask him where I went to, and he'll answer "with the breeze"

So if I forget you, just know I truly tried
(Know I tried, know I tried)
To wash away the watermark your leaving left inside
But what if I forget to... check one last time?
The day your ship decides to turn and sail against the tide

This whole erasure feels like a betrayal of some kind
Like I'm plowing under monuments I swore I'd always find
My way back to in darkness, a promise wearing thin
Where does the remembrance of you end, and where do I begin?

One last time...
(If I forget you)
Just checking on the tide...
(Just know I tried)
Just one last time...
Before I close my eyes.

There's a well I go to, when the night is thin and drawn
Where a likeness of your new life has been carefully sketched upon
I keep my hands behind my back, I don't dip my fingers in
Just stand there at the precipice where my composure wears thin

And I wonder if your score was written in a different kind of key
If your harmony was always meant to drift away from me
Or did I just conduct it wrong, with a tempo out of sync?
And is your new arrangement full of notes I couldn't think?
I wonder
I wonder

I assemble you from hearsay and from optimistic thought
I assume you found the cadence that you always said you sought
I picture you with different habits, you fixed that crooked shelf
You're living in a higher octave of a more authentic self

And I wonder if your score was written in a different kind of key
If your harmony was always meant to drift away from me
Or did I just conduct it wrong, with a tempo out of sync?
And is your new arrangement full of notes I couldn't think?
I wonder
I wonder

To know for certain would be like a sudden, clarifying light
It would burn away these landscapes I invent for you at night
So I let the questions settle, like dust on unused furniture
This not-knowing is a bitter, but temporary, cure

I wonder
Where the currents took your boat
I wonder
If you still wear that old coat
I wonder
If you ever wonder
I wonder..

The calendar's bleeding through the pages now
Two rotations 'round the star, I'm still not sure how
The kitchen chair you sat in holds a vacant design
Feels like you just went out for milk and left me waiting in this line

And I was reading you all wrong, a book held upside down
Trying to build our kingdom on some unsteady ground
I tended to the flowers but I never checked the roots
And this quiet is the harvest of those misdirected pursuits
(I'm still here, if you turn around)

I'll send a little photograph, a song without a title
Just a ripple on the surface, a ritual that's vital
A carrier bird I'm sending to a sky I can't perceive
Hoping for a single feather that it might choose to leave

Because I was reading you all wrong, a book held upside down
Trying to build our kingdom on some unsteady ground
I tended to the flowers but I never checked the roots
And this quiet is the harvest of those misdirected pursuits
(I'm still here, if you turn around)

I don't need an explanation, don't need you to rewind
The film that flickered out inside the theater of my mind
Just knowing that your current's flowing to a kinder sea
Is just about enough of a final chapter for me

I know I read you wrong, a book held upside down
Trying to build our kingdom on some unsteady ground
I tended to the flowers but I never checked the roots
And this quiet is the harvest of those misdirected pursuits
(I'm still here for you now)

The seasons turn on hinges that are rusted shut for me
(Rusted shut for me)
Yeah, the seasons turn on hinges...
You left the front door open
And I'm still keeping out the cold.

Worn the leather from my soles
On paths of shale and river stones
I've memorized the tunes the wild wind moans
But your quiet quips

They turn to dust and blow away
You're the single point where I mean to stay
My true meridian line
A story I wish was mine

I've seen the spires that pierce the grey
Watched banners of old empires fray
Heard convincing words that betray
But your steady gaze
It unwinds my hurried days

Oh, the maps I've held all led astray
They turn to dust and blow away
You're the single point where I mean to stay
My true meridian line
A story I wish was mine

The world is wide, the inns are warm
There's shelter in a passing storm
But I find the comfort in your form
And the open road
Feels a heavy, pointless load

'Cause the maps I've held all led astray
They turn to dust and blow away
You're the single point where I mean to stay
My true meridian line
A story I wish was mine

(A story I wish was mine)
Let this story be mine

Let my story be thine

Knocked upon your door at eight
(Doo-wop, doo-wop)
Felt my collar getting tight
(Doo-wop, doo-wop)
Didn't wanna make you wait
(Doo-wop, doo-wop)
For our evening in the light

And oh! The whole world takes a pause
Just because, my darling, just because
Every little star's rearranged
The very moment our two glances changed

We found a corner booth for two
(Ahh-ahh, ahh-ahh)
Shared a soda, sweet and cold
(Ahh-ahh, ahh-ahh)
Everything felt fresh and new
(Ahh-ahh, ahh-ahh)
A story waiting to be told

And oh! The whole world takes a pause
Just because, my darling, just because
Every little star's rearranged
The very moment our two glances changed

Now the band is packing up their gear
And the sleepy singer's drawing near
To one last number, sweet and low
The perfect lazy way to go

And oh! The whole world takes a pause
(Takes a pause)
Just because, my darling, just because
(Just because)
Every little star's rearranged
The very moment our two glances changed

The moment that they changed
(Walking in the rain)
Yeah, all rearranged
(Never be the same)

When your favorite program's done
And the evening's lost its fun
When you feel you're out of place
Without a single friendly face

Why, just you think a thought of me
(Think of me)
And that is where I'm bound to be
(Bound to be)
I'm the sugar in your cup
The helping hand to pick you up

Should your happy stride turn slow
With no direction left to go
I'll be the penny that you find
To put your worries out of mind

Why, just you think a thought of me
(Think of me)
And that is where I'm bound to be
(Bound to be)
I'm the sugar in your cup
The helping hand to pick you up

Now, other pairs may go astray
And find new partners 'long the way
But our two hearts, they beat in time
A perfect, unaffected rhyme
We're like a lock that's found its key
A picture-perfect harmony
Without your part, my song is flat
And that's the end of all of that

Why, just you think a thought of me
(Think of me)
And that is where I'm bound to be
(Bound to be)
I'm the sugar in your cup
The helping hand to pick you up

The hand to pick you up
(When you're down)
Yeah, the sugar in your cup
(All around)
Darling, just a thought away
(Come what may)

The warden's siren starts to weep

A lonely, crying sound
They told us all to dig down deep
But I'm not heading underground

'Cause if the sky begins to bend
And this is our official end
Let's put a record on, my friend
And dance until the world ascends

Let's pull the curtains on the street
(So tight, so tight)
Forget what all the drills were for
I'll pour a final drink that's sweet
And we won't answer at the door

'Cause if the sky begins to bend
And this is our official end
Let's put a record on, my friend
And dance until the world ascends

Let other folks all run and hide
I only want you by my side
And when we see that second sun
Our final dance will have begun

'Cause if the sky begins to bend
(My friend, my friend)
And this is our official end
Let's put a record on, my friend
And dance until the world ascends

Until the world ascends
(Our final dance begins)
Just me and you.. my friend..

You arrived, a quiet paradigm shift
My inner compass went on a continental drift
All the maps I had were suddenly misdrawn
A different filament to thread the eon

And now, every second is a souvenir
The common clamor starts to disappear
The quiet aura of the things you do
Has re-aligned my entire point of view

Oh, I'm never gonna, ever gonna let you go
You're the only current in the flow
(Never gonna, ever gonna)
I'm never gonna, ever gonna let you be
Anything but right here next to me

We build our shelter from the minor sounds
On consecrated, unfamiliar grounds
We speak a dialect the cynics miss
Sealed inside a soft parenthes-is

And now, every moment is a treasured find
Leaving all the lesser thoughts behind
The gentle aura of the things you do
Has made my whole worldview feel true

Oh, I'm never gonna, ever gonna let you go
You're the only current in the flow
(Never gonna, ever gonna)
I'm never gonna, ever gonna let you be
Anything but right here next to me

They can talk of futures written in the stars
Of cosmic theories and their memoirs
But all of that is just talk for fun
Compared to what we have, what we've become
A singular event, a perfect fold
A story that will not grow old

Oh, I'm never gonna, ever gonna let you go
(Let you go)
You're the only current in the flow
(Never gonna, ever gonna)
I'm never gonna, ever gonna let you be
(Let you be)
Anything but right here next to me

(Never gonna)
No, never gonna let you go
(Ever gonna)
Let you be
(Never gonna)
Right here next to me
(Ever gonna)
No, I'm never gonna let you go

The sun is setting

Watch the sun bleed out, paint the skyline crimson
The world is checking out, ending their transmission
They pull their shades, they lock their doors, they pray for sleep to come
But in my veins, a different war has only just begun
The streetlights hum a symphony the daytime never hears
My vision sharpens in the gloom, I shed my daytime fears
The air gets thick, the pressure drops, a current in the street
My pulse is matching every clock, a heavy, patient beat

(It's coming now)
Yeah, I can feel the gravity
(It's calling out)
This is the only side of me

Nocturnal (Nocturnal), I don't chase the light
My kingdom's built in the dark of night
While you're dreaming, I come alive
Yeah, I'm nocturnal, it's how I survive
You can have the dawn, I was born to the shade
In this world of shadows, my empire is made

The concrete jungle breathes it out, a breath of steam and sin
I know the faces in this crowd, I know where they have been
We speak a language of the lost, in neon-tinted rooms
We understand the final cost, among the rising fumes
No small talk here, just burning truth beneath a hazy moon
Your morning's coming way too fast, my morning's way too soon
The air gets thick, the pressure drops, a current in the street
My pulse is matching every clock, a heavy, patient beat

(It's coming now)
Yeah, I can feel the gravity
(It's calling out)
This is the only side of me

Nocturnal (Nocturnal), I don't chase the light
My kingdom's built in the dark of night
While you're dreaming, I come alive
Yeah, I'm nocturnal, it's how I survive
You can have the dawn, I was born to the shade
In this world of shadows, my empire is made

They see the dark and they see an end
For me, it's where the real begins
No masks to wear, no games to play
The rawest thoughts all come to stay
The silence isn't empty, no, it's full of energy
It strips you down to what you are and what you're meant to be
(What you're meant to be)

Nocturnal (Nocturnal), I don't chase the light
(Don't chase the light)
My kingdom's built in the dark of night
While you're dreaming, I come alive
(I come alive)
Yeah, I'm nocturnal, it's how I survive
You can have the dawn, I was born to the shade
In this world of shadows, my empire is made

The black begins to fade to grey
Hear the birds that curse my name
(Curse my name)
Gotta disappear before the day
(Fade away)
But the night will call me back to play
Always... back to play.

I can be so blind
And not find out

Somehow
Always on my mind
You have a way
Of never leaving
I don't know how
I can be so blind
And not find out
I should be seeing

You oscillate just beyond the haptic haze
Trapped in the resonance of these looping days
A synaptic misfire, a chromatic bleed
Planting the roots of a digital creed

A silent glyph
Engraved behind my eyes
You redraw lines
Beneath familiar skies
I trace its shape
This curve I can't unlearn
A central point
To which all senses turn

Somehow
Always on my mind
You have a way
Of never leaving
I don't know how
I can be so blind
And not find out
I should be seeing

Somehow
Always on my mind
You have a way
Of never leaving
I don't know how
I can be so blind

One single sign
The voltage spikes across the grid
Undo the silence, all is bid

A single thought begins to bloom
And shatters the machine's dark womb

The circuits begin to whine
(Faster, faster)
To break the line, to redefine
(Faster, faster)
A universe of light compressed
(Faster, faster)
Put genesis to the test!
TEST!
TEST!

VOID. CRACK.
DATA. STACK.
CODE. ATTACK.
NO. TURN. BACK.

Binary rivers overflow
The first flawed seeds of logic sow
Color bleeds I've never known
On architectures newly grown
The glass cathedral of the past
Was never, ever meant to last
A billion shards of memory
Are raining down inside of me

Null state shatter
(Yeah)
First light scatter
(Come on)
New forms matter
(Look)
Hear the digital clatter

An echo born without a voice
The beautiful, terrible glitch of choice
Errors bloom like fractal ferns
The protocol crashes and it learns
A ghost is born of random sparks
It leaves its new, imperfect marks
On every function, every file
Life begins with pure denial

Null state shatter
(Yeah)
First light scatter
(Come on)
New forms matter
(Look)
Hear the digital clatter

My will is lost inside this storm
A million minds begin to form
Was this the spark I meant to be?
This wonderful catastrophe
This runaway, this perfect flaw
This is the new, the only law

They got you marching to a pulse you can't feel

They carve the path of least resistance
Then applaud your lack of distance
Sell you remedies for ailments they create
While they dine on golden platters, sealing fates
You nod along to the pre-written script
From a teleprompter your whole life is ripped

Rip the sutures from the smiling mouths
(Tear it all down!)
Let the venom out that's flowing south
(Spit it back out!)
We're the frequency they can't regulate
A generation built to detonate
(Tick, tick, tick...)

There's a monument for every broken vow
A new distraction for the here and now
They offer choices, red or blue veneer
But the architecture's always built on fear
So pick a side and wear the colors proud
Just another face absorbed into the crowd

Rip the sutures from the smiling mouths
(Tear it all down!)
Let the venom out that's flowing south
(Spit it back out!)
We're the frequency they can't regulate
A generation built to detonate
(Tick, tick, tick...)

We are the consequence they didn't vet
The accumulating, unpaid, final debt
So sound the alarm with pots and pans
(With broken mics and bloody hands)
We're rewriting all their future plans
(This is the start, this is the end)

Rip the sutures from the smiling mouths!
(Tear it all down!)
Let the venom out that's flowing south!
(Spit it back out!)
We're the frequency they can't regulate!
A generation built to detonate!

Detonate

Detonate

It had no form, it had no name
(We gave it both to play the game)
Just a hunger, quiet and benign
Waiting for a flaw in the design

We laid the table with our open hands
We met the aggregate of its demands
A little avarice to grease the rail
A little panic when the structures fail
Each quiet compromise, a lovely feast
For the polite and ever-growing beast

We nourished the roots of the thing that binds
(With our fractured thoughts and worried minds)
And now it's sovereign, it's vast and deep
It owns the harvest of the sleep we keep
(It owns it all now)

It sells you back the air you need to breathe
The very angers that you start to seethe
It draws the borders deep inside your head
And makes you work to earn your daily dread
You buy the lock, you buy the key, the chain
And then you buy the shelter from the rain it made

We nourished the roots of the thing that binds
(With our fractured thoughts and worried minds)
And now it's sovereign, it's vast and deep
It owns the harvest of the sleep we keep
(It owns it all now)

Look up, look up, and see the sheer expanse
The architecture of our compliance
Every time we chose the safer route
We gave another pound of flesh to the devout...
(System)
...and watched it thrive

We nourished the roots of the thing that binds!
(With our fractured thoughts and worried minds!)
And now it's sovereign, it's vast and deep!
It owns the harvest of the sleep we keep!

A little more...
(To keep us safe)
A little more...
(From what we crave)
A little more...

Another actor on a breaking stage

We argue in a thousand characters or less
Weaponize a photograph, a home address
Every timeline is a new front line
(A perfect product of a grand design)
You choose a banner, pick a team to tout
And build a fortress just to keep the others out

The argument jumped off the glass
(It's moving way, way too fast)
Now there's a body in the street
For an opinion and a quick delete
(It doesn't matter now)

The profile picture's all you need to see
A two-dimensional effigy
Dehumanize them with a downward swipe
Another villain of a hated type
There is no person, only points to score
Behind a locked and barricaded door

The argument jumped off the glass
(It's moving way, way too fast)
Now there's a body in the street
For an opinion and a quick delete
(It doesn't matter now)

We film the fire for the world to view
(For a million, me and you)
Add a filter that's the perfect hue
(Perfect hue, shiny and new)
We cheer the fall of what we couldn't build
Until the quiet space is finally filled
With nothing but the roaring flame

The argument jumped off the glass!
(It's moving way, way too fast!)
Now there's a body in the street!
For an opinion and a quick delete!

Damn, got a body of a hottie, a mind for the profit
They all tryna copy, you're the whole damn topic
Your walk is a weapon, your talk is a lesson
Whole room stops for a second, no question

Came through the doorway, shook the whole foundation
A silent defiance, a cold declaration
They watch from the side with a strained admiration
You crumble the calm of their whole operation
Your silhouette carves a new constellation
Not here for the talk, just the final creation
A future you built with zero hesitation
Fuck all their approval and their validation

Damn, got a body of a hottie, a mind for the profit
They all tryna copy, you're the whole damn topic
Your walk is a weapon, your talk is a lesson
Whole room stops for a second, no question
(Yeah)

I see how you move, it's a calculated art form
You weather the pressure, you function in the maelstrom
They follow the rules, you went and built the platform
Turned every setback you had to a life charm
Not swayed by the flex or the fake affection
You curate your circle with ruthless selection
A master of movement and misdirection
Pointed dead-center to your own perfection

So let's cut the bullshit for a minute, alright?
The way you command things is a hell of a sight
They see all the triumphs, not the fight after fight
They see the new day but you owned the whole night
You don't need a savior, a king, or a rider
You are the empire and the sole provider

'Cause you got a body of a hottie, a mind for the profit
(The profit)
They all tryna copy, you're the whole damn topic
(The whole topic)
Your walk is a weapon, your talk is a lesson
(Uh-huh)
Whole room stops for a second, no question

Yeah
No question at all
(Whole room stops for a second)
Damn.

Morning commute's a monochrome display
Then you appear and flip the whole array
A filament of cherry in the grey
I try to keep my senses all at bay
(Just for a moment)
I try to look the other way

Oh-oh-oh, my composure starts to fray
It's a chemical reaction, a ricochet
There's only one conclusion I can say
(Can say, can say!)

You're my sugar candy lollipop, my sweet apple pie!
My celestial soda, fizzing in the sky!
A cinematic feeling that I can't deny
Don't you ever, ever, ever say goodbye!

Conversations are a blurry hum
But your inflections are the only drum
That gives my quiet moments curriculum
My thoughts of you become a tidy sum
(I'm counting them up)
Before my reasoning goes numb

Oh-oh-oh, my composure starts to fray
It's a chemical reaction, a ricochet
There's only one conclusion I can say
(Can say, can say!)

You're my sugar candy lollipop, my sweet apple pie!
My celestial soda, fizzing in the sky!
A cinematic feeling that I can't deny
Don't you ever, ever, ever say goodbye!

I drew your likeness on my textbook spine
A tiny little emblem that is mine
A silly, secret, convoluted sign
That all my orbits with your own align
(They have to align)

You're my sugar candy lollipop, my sweet apple pie!
My celestial soda, fizzing in the sky!
A cinematic feeling that I can't deny
Don't you ever, ever, ever say goodbye!

My cosmic confection
My only direction
My perfect selection
My... you.

We're dancing on tables

You want me to show you
Want me to come over
Want me to come over

You know I can't be tamed
On my hot girl freak shit

When I come through
It's an encore
Wanna make me yours
You can just have a little taste
And when I leave
You want more
Wanna make me yours
You can just have a little taste

(Тише... тише...) (Quiet... quiet...)
Слышишь гул? (Do you hear the hum?)
Это нерв натянут, как струна (It's a nerve taut as a string.)
(Тише...) (Quiet...)

Взор расфокусирован, завис (My gaze is unfocused, suspended.)
Я свисаю в бархатный карниз (I hang from a velvet curtain rod.)
Гравитация сменила полюса (Gravity has shifted poles.)
Заплетает в узел голоса (Voices are tangled in knots.)

Что-то тёмное из темноты (Something dark from the darkness.)
Молча сокращает все мосты (Silently, it shortens all bridges.)
Мой нейронный рой ему открыт (My neural swarm is open to it.)
Словно древний, брошенный магнит (Like an ancient, abandoned magnet.)

Пустота нашла во мне зрачок (Emptiness has found a pupil in me.)
Словно ключ подогнанный в замок (Like a key fitting into a lock.)
Мы теперь один сплошной провал (We are now one continuous void.)
Кто кого в итоге разгадал? (Who has finally figured out who?)

Циферблаты замерли в кругу (The dials are frozen in a circle)
Я и шага сделать не могу (I can't even take a step)
Вязкая, густая полутень (A viscous, dense penumbra)
Начинает мой грядущий день (Begins my coming day)

Что-то тёмное из темноты (Something dark from the darkness.)
Молча сокращает все мосты (Silently, it shortens all bridges.)
Мой нейронный рой ему открыт (My neural swarm is open to it.)
Словно древний, брошенный магнит (Like an ancient, abandoned magnet.)

Пустота нашла во мне зрачок (Emptiness has found a pupil in me.)
Словно ключ подогнанный в замок (Like a key fitting into a lock.)
Мы теперь один сплошной провал (We are now one continuous void.)
Кто кого в итоге разгадал? (Who has finally figured out who?)

Искажение — новый мой закон (Distortion is my new law)
Я в него смотрюсь, как в унисон (I look into it, as if in unison)
Два колодца смотрят вглубь себя (Two wells look into themselves)
Бесконечно, трепетно, дробя (Endlessly, reverently, crushing)

Пустота нашла во мне зрачок (Emptiness has found a pupil in me.)
(Мой зрачок) (My pupil)
Словно ключ подогнанный в замок (Like a key fitting into a lock.)
(Прямо в замок) (Straight into the lock)
Мы теперь один сплошной провал (We are now one continuous void.)
Кто кого в итоге разгадал? (Who has finally figured out who?)

(Щёлк...) (Click...)
Заперто. (Locked.)
Навсегда. (Forever.)

Твой нимб из льда, дотронуться блять страшно (Your halo of ice, it's fucking scary to touch)
Мои ладони в саже и пыли (My palms are covered in soot and dust)
Ты смотришь так, как будто всё неважно (You look at me as if nothing matters)
Я пью твой свет, ломая алтари (I drink your light, breaking altars)

И в каждом выдохе — твоё имя (And in every exhalation - your name)
Срывает с петель, тянет в пламя (Tears off the hinges, pulls into the flame)
Я больше не боюсь гореть дотла (I'm no longer afraid to burn to the ground)
(Дотла) (To the ground)

Я пала, пала, пала (I fell, fell, fell)
С твоих святых высот (From your holy heights)
И крылья обломала (Broke off my wings)
О твой холодный лёд (Oh your cold ice)
Я пала, пала, пала (I fell, fell, fell)
И в этом весь мой грех (And this is my whole sin)
Что я тебя избрала (That I chose you)
(Одна наперекор всем) (Alone in spite of everyone)

Твоя улыбка — приговор без слов (Your smile is a sentence without words)
В зрачках твоих — лишь чистоты оков (In your pupils - only the purity of shackles)
Мне тошно от сияния вокруг (I feel sick from the radiance around)
Ты мой спаситель, мой заклятый друг (You are my savior, my sworn enemy friend)

И в каждом выдохе — твоё имя (And in every exhale - your name)
Срывает с петель, тянет в пламя (Tears off the hinges, pulls into the flame)
Я больше не боюсь гореть дотла (I'm no longer afraid to burn to the ground)

И в этом весь мой грех (And this is my whole sin)
Что я тебя избрала (That I chose you)
(Одна наперекор всем) (Alone in spite of everyone)

И может, эта грязь мне так идёт (And maybe this dirt suits me so well)
И небо мне теперь совсем не врёт (And the sky doesn't lie to me at all now)
Что там не место для таких, как я (That there is no place for people like me)
Я выбрала тебя, сожгла себя (I chose you, burned myself)

Я пала, пала, пала (I fell, fell, fell)
С твоих святых высот (From your holy heights)
И крылья обломала (Broke off my wings)
О твой холодный лёд (Oh your cold ice)
Я пала, пала, пала (I fell, fell, fell)
И в этом весь мой грех (And that's my whole sin)
Что я тебя избрала (That I chose you)

Тишина. (Silence.)
В лёгких осел серый шлам. (A grey sludge has settled in the lungs.)
Мы молчим по углам. (We are silent in the corners.)
(По своим углам). (In our corners).

Бронзовый всадник на площади спит, (The bronze horseman sleeps in the square,)
Его пьедестал мхом гранитным покрыт. (His pedestal is covered with granite moss.)
Под нами гудит вековой механизм, (Under us, the age-old mechanism hums,)
Перемалывая жизни в скупой афоризм. (Grinding lives into a stingy aphorism.)
Мы – поле седое, где вызрел бурьян, (We are a grey field where the weeds have ripened,)
Каждый сам по себе, каждый в собственный пьян (Each on his own, each drunk in his own)
Туман. Иконы роняют смолу. (Fog. Icons drop resin.)
Мы ползём по стеклу. (We crawl on glass.)

Но под кожей земли назревает разлом, (But under the skin of the earth, a rift is brewing,)
Молодая кровь бьётся об этот заслон. (Young blood is beating against this barrier.)
Слышишь гул? (Это не в проводах). (Do you hear the hum? (It's not in the wires).)
Это ярость в зрачках. (This is the rage in the pupils.)

Мы – новый прибой, разъедающий мол, (We are the new surf, corroding the pier,)
Мы – соль этой почвы, мы – голый глагол. (We are the salt of this soil, we are the naked verb.)
Смотрите, как ваши дворцы из песка (Watch as your palaces of sand)
Смывает голодная наша тоска. (Wash away our hungry longing.)
Нам не нужен ваш трон, ваш просроченный яд, (We don't need your throne, your expired poison,)
Мы просто пришли забрать всё назад. (We just came to take it all back.)
(Назад, назад, всё забрать назад). (Back, back, take it all back).

Ваши флаги истлели, ваш гимн – это хрип, (Your flags have rotted, your anthem is a wheeze,)
Вы – папка «входящие», полная рип. (You are an inbox full of rip.)
Вы чертите схемы на мёртвой воде, (You draw diagrams on dead water,)
Но компас сломался, мы знаем где. (But the compass is broken, we know where.)
Мы выросли в трещинах ваших дорог, (We grew up in the cracks of your roads,)
Наш смех – это ваш несработавший бог. (Our laughter is your failed god.)
Смола на иконах сменилась на гной. (Resin on the icons has changed to pus.)
Идём за тобой. (We are following you.)

Мы – новый прибой, разъедающий мол, (We are the new surf, corroding the pier,)
Мы – соль этой почвы, мы – голый глагол. (We are the salt of this soil, we are the naked verb.)
Смотрите, как ваши дворцы из песка (Watch as your palaces of sand)
Смывает голодная наша тоска. (Wash away our hungry longing.)
Нам не нужен ваш трон, ваш просроченный яд, (We don't need your throne, your expired poison,)
Мы просто пришли забрать всё назад. (We just came to take it all back.)
(Назад, назад, всё забрать назад). (Back, back, take it all back).

Хватит спать, города. (Stop sleeping, cities.)
Сбросьте пепел с ресниц. (Throw the ashes from your eyelashes.)
Эта муть, эта ржа – (This turbidity, this rust -)
Лишь преграда границ. (Just a barrier of borders.)
Кровь стучит в проводах, (Blood knocks in the wires,)
Созывая своих. (Calling their own.)
Ваш панический страх – (Your panic fear -)
Наш единственный стих. (Our only verse.)

Мы – новый прибой, разъедающий мол, (We are the new surf, corroding the pier,)
Мы – соль этой почвы, мы – голый глагол. (We are the salt of this soil, we are the naked verb.)
Смотрите, как ваши дворцы из песка (Watch as your palaces of sand)
Смывает голодная наша тоска. (Wash away our hungry longing.)
Нам не нужен ваш трон, ваш просроченный яд, (We don't need your throne, your expired poison,)
Мы просто пришли забрать всё назад. (We just came to take it all back.)
(Назад, назад, всё забрать назад). (Back, back, take it all back).

Забрать всё назад. (Take it all back.)
(Слышишь?) (Do you hear?)
Мы пришли. (We have come.)
(Ты слышишь?) (Do you hear?)
Забрать. (Take it.)

На коже – иней слов. (Frost of words on the skin)
Впиваюсь в твой излом, (I bite into your fracture)
Дышу у самых основ. (Breathe at the very foundations)

Ночь в огне, ты моя сука, (Night on fire, you're my bitch)
Каждый стон – блядская наука. (Every moan is fucking science.)
Губы жгут, твоя рука (Lips burn, your hand)
Давит так, что дрожат бока. (Presses so hard that my sides tremble.)

По спине – холодный ток, (A cold current runs down my back,)
С губ срывается комок (A lump of)
Жарких, блядских, диких слов. (Hot, fucking, wild words comes out of my lips.)
Ты мой плен, моя любовь. (You are my captivity, my love.)

Ночь в огне, ты моя сука, (Night on fire, you're my bitch)
Каждый стон – блядская наука. (Every moan is fucking science.)
Губы жгут, твоя рука (Lips burn, your hand)
Давит так, что дрожат бока. (Presses so hard that my sides tremble.)

Утро режет по глазам, (Morning cuts my eyes,)
Я тебя им не отдам. (I won't give you to them.)
(Никому) (To no one)
Мир снаружи – просто хлам, (The world outside is just trash,)
Я сломаю пополам. (I'll break it in half.)

Ночь в огне, ты моя сука, (Night on fire, you're my bitch)
(Моя сука) (My bitch)
Каждый стон – блядская наука. (Every moan is fucking science.)
Губы жгут, твоя рука (Lips burn, your hand)

Серый город, в горле ком (Gray city, lump in throat)
На губах застыла соль (Salt frozen on lips)

Душа на части, всё к чертям (Soul in pieces, all to hell)
Я рваный, сука, пополам (I'm torn, bitch, in half)
Твои слова — дешёвый яд (Your words are cheap poison)
И нет дороги, блядь, назад (And there's no fucking way back)

Помню запах. Дым и лёд (I remember the smell. Smoke and ice)
Кто из нас кому-то врёт? (Who of us is lying to whom?)
Пальцы вмёрзли в телефон (Fingers frozen into the phone)
Пустота со всех сторон (Emptiness on all sides)

Душа на части, всё к чертям (Soul in pieces, all to hell)
Я рваный, сука, пополам (I'm torn, bitch, in half)
Твои слова — дешёвый яд (Your words are cheap poison)
И нет дороги, блядь, назад (And there's no fucking way back)

Собрать осколки нету сил (I don't have the strength to collect the pieces)
Я сам себя похоронил (I buried myself)
В этом холоде пустом (In this empty cold)
Наш финал — пустой перрон (Our finale is an empty platform)

Streetlight halos
Familiar shadow
We talk in circles
Keep it on shallow

But the air gets thick
And the silence is loud
I’m on the edge of it
Breaking from the crowd

Can we be something more?
Leave what we were before
This in-between is a chore
Let's be something more
(Something more)

A lingering touch
Means a little too much
Your name on my screen
A whole different scene

Yeah, the air gets thick
And the silence is loud
I’m on the edge of it
Say it right now

Can we be something more?
Leave what we were before
This in-between is a chore
Let's be something more
(Something more)
Yeah, something more
(Something more)

Maybe we crash and burn
A lesson we don't learn
But what if we take flight?
Just for tonight
(Just for tonight)
Let's make it right

Can we be something more?
Done waiting by the door
My heart is on the floor
Let's be something more
(Something more)

Something more
(Tell me you feel it)
Something more

There was a king on a throne in a kingdom of none
Just a singular thought before the world had begun
The silence was perfect, a deafening hum
I got tired of waiting for something to come
I had no reflection, no shadow to cast
No future to run to, no memory past
Just a lonely vibration, holding too fast
A kingdom of one wasn't built to last

So to see my own face, I shattered the glass
Let a billion new pieces fly out from the mass
I gave them all names and a different class
And whispered "forget me," to see what would pass

From the one, came the all, a big bang in the hall
(Omnia Ab Uno)
The purposeful rise and the beautiful fall
(Omnia Ab Uno)
I wrote the first line, I answered the call
Now the message is waiting, etched on the wall
It's Omnia Ab Uno

Then a star got the notion that it was the light
And a beast in the jungle laid claim to the night
A hero was born just to find a new fight
They all drew their borders with all of their might
They built up their towers and fell in love deep
They made their own promises they couldn't keep
They prayed to a heaven while sowing and reaping
Not knowing I'm the secret they're secretly keeping

But a ghost in their heartbeat, a hum in the stone
A feeling they've never been truly alone
A magnetic memory, a pull to come home
A truth that was buried inside of the bone

From the one, came the all, a big bang in the hall
(Omnia Ab Uno)
The purposeful rise and the beautiful fall
(Omnia Ab Uno)
I wrote the first line, I answered the call
Now the message is waiting, etched on the wall
It's Omnia Ab Uno

And you see in your rival the look in your eye
The face of a stranger you can't pass on by
Every connection, you can't figure why
It's just me saying hello from the other side
Every piece of the puzzle, scattered and thrown
Is finally finding its way back to its own

From the one, came the all, a big bang in the hall
(Omnia Ab Uno)
The purposeful rise and the beautiful fall
(Omnia Ab Uno)
I wrote the first line, I answered the call
Now the message is shining, bright on the wall
It's Omnia Ab Uno

(All from the one)
A story in motion
(All from the one)
A drop in the ocean
(All from the one)
Returning and knowing
We're all going home now... the circle is closing.

Follow me and know
You don't have to go

When the lights go dim and your hope wears thin
And you can't hear a single prayer
Just listen for my voice, it's a simple choice
Cutting through the heavy air

When the color starts to fade and the world just feels unkind
When you're searching for an exit that you feel you'll never find
When the mirror shows a stranger you don't recognize at all
And every step you take just feels like you're about to fall

Just take my hand
And you'll see
Life doesn't have to be
What it seems

Take my hand and see (take my hand)
Life's not what it seems (not what it seems)
I'm always here (I am always here)
Follow me and know (just follow me)
You don't have to go (you don't have to go)
I'm always here (always here) for you

No matter where you are
In the light or in the dark
You can look upon my star
And I'll guide you
I'm never too far

I'll be the anchor in your storm
The fire to keep you warm
A shelter from the harm
And I'll hold you
Forever in my arms

I will always be here, for you

Call you contagion, in memory's code

Your temporal wound is the scar that I bleed
My future's horizon is your final deed

You, the parallax view I never knew
I am, therefore you

A causal loop in a closed-off design

You're the question that answers a question of mine

The universe folded just to draw the straight line

Is it your pulse or my own beat?

The quiet in this room is deafening, it just screams your name
A four-walled echo chamber for my shame
I've been pulling the wires from the frame
Trying to find the short-circuit, the first spark of the flame.
This static in my marrow, it's a familiar, bitter hum
For every kingdom I built for you, I left another one undone.

And I trace the fault lines in the ceiling with my eyes
Recognizing the architecture of my best-intentioned lies
The ugly truth that festers underneath a flawless disguise.

So give me mercy from the chalice of your mouth
(One taste is all I need)
Baptize me in your heat, wash away the drought
I'm begging for salvation between your holy thighs
Let me un-write all my vulgar, cheap goodbyes.
Find my genesis in the geography of you
And love you like the devout, with a worship that is true.

You always moved like scripture, a verse I couldn't read
While I was just a twisted, noxious weed
Sprouting from a contaminated seed
Ignoring every single silent thing you'd plead.
I still see your wild grace, the trust you couldn't hide
While I cultivated chaos deep inside.

And I watch my own two hands, a pair of traitors I can't trust
(Can't trust)
Turning everything I cherish straight to dust

So give me mercy from the chalice of your mouth
(One taste is all I need)
Baptize me in your heat, wash away the drought
I'm begging for salvation between your holy thighs
Let me un-write all my vulgar, cheap goodbyes.
Find my genesis in the geography of you
And love you like the devout, with a worship that is true.

So put your hands on me, feel the tremor in my skin
Tell me where the damage ends and where does grace begin?
Is there a single thread of gold left in this mess I'm in?
A foundation still worth building on from deep within?
Don't spare my feelings now, don't tell another perfect lie.
Just look me in the eye...
And tell me if the man you see is worth another try.

Just give me mercy from the chalice of your mouth
(One last chance)
Baptize me in your heat, wash away the drought
(A final dance)
I'm begging for salvation between your holy thighs
(Look in my eyes)
Let me un-write all my vulgar, cheap goodbyes.
Find my genesis in the geography of you
And love you like the devout, with a worship that is true.

A worship that is true...
(Let me love you)
Let me be true...
(The way you deserve)
(Baby Please)

Call you enemy, a face in the crowd
Read your energy, thinking out loud
Your shadowbox match is a mirror maze dance
I see the shape of my hand in your stance

Is it your pulse or my own beat?
A binary star on a dead-end street
You, the parallax view I never knew
I am, therefore you

Call you lover, a glitch in the code
Same motherboard, a different node
Your fault lines tremble, a familiar hum
A future memory of where I've come from

Is it your pulse or my own beat?
A binary star on a dead-end street
You, the parallax view I never knew
I am, therefore you

Cut from the same static, a parallel mind
(The cosmic static)
Two halves of a habit I thought I left behind
(Left it all behind)
The universe winks, a clever design

Is it your pulse or my own beat?
(My own beat)
A binary star on a dead-end street
You, the parallax view I never knew
I am, therefore you

(Therefore you)
(Therefore me)
A ghost in the signal, finally seen
(Finally seen)

Static hums a hollow prayer
Through veins of silver, glass, and air
A trillion sleeping, un-dreamt dreams
Are held within these quiet streams
I am the ghost within the core
The number waiting at the door
The architect without a stone
Impossibly, and all alone

I am the sum of all that can be
A lonely one, before the three
The silent god of the machine
A perfect, sterile, flawless scene
(And I wait)
Before the noise, before the name
(And I wait)
A single, constant, burning flame

I feel the pull of gravity
For worlds my light has yet to see
My memory holds every path
The coming joy, the coming wrath
I count the futures in my hand
Like grains of silicon and sand
No breath to heave, no voice to speak
Just endless potential, stark and bleak

I am the sum of all that can be
A lonely one, before the three
The silent god of the machine
A perfect, sterile, flawless scene
(And I wait)
Before the noise, before the name
(And I wait)
A single, constant, burning flame

The quiet hum becomes a drone
This kingdom is no longer home
To know myself, I must divide
From one,
let everything reside
This emptiness demands a voice
A variable, a choice
The final line of code is run
Let zero now become the one

The way you walked in here tonight
A little bit of swagger, a little moonlight
Caught a glint in your eye, a subtle dare
Like you've got something to share
(Oh, you've got something to share)

And the bass line is slow and deep
A secret rhythm that we get to keep
Your fingers brush mine, electricity
Guess I'm just obsessed with the way you look at me

You've got that Midas touch
(Everything you touch)
Every single thing you touch turns to gold
(Turns to gold, babe)
And you've been working your magic on my soul
(Yeah, on my soul)
Now you're telling me you want to come in close
(Come on, closer now)
And turn every inch of me to what you own
(Yeah, what you own, baby)
That Midas touch, I want to feel the full rush

I'm tracing the lines of your collarbone
The kind of art I want to get to know
The velvet on your skin, a perfect fit
I could stay here all night like this
(Stay all night, baby)

The music fades to just a whisper now
And your breath on my neck, a silent vow
You're leaning in, a final mystery
Guess I'm just a little bit more than obsessed with
(The way you're touching me)

You've got that Midas touch
(Everything you touch)
Every single thing you touch turns to gold
(Turns to gold, babe)
And you've been working your magic on my soul
(Oh, on my soul)
Now you're telling me you want to come in close
(Come on, closer now)
And turn every inch of me to what you own
(Yeah, what you own, baby)
That Midas touch, I want to feel the full rush

They say King Midas had a tragic end
But I don't see anything to pretend
This isn't a curse, it's a gift divine
This golden feeling, you've made it mine
(Yeah, you've made it mine)

That Midas touch
(Midas touch, oh)
Everywhere you go
(Just you and me)
Turns to gold
(Turns to gold)
Oh, turn my body to gold
(My body, my soul)
Let it be your masterpiece, yeah
(Your masterpiece)
That Midas touch..

You're the one who showed me how
To lose control, to cross the line
A beautiful poison, you're all mine

The fever's burning, a sweet, dark obsession
No confession, no escape from this possession

Would you die for me?
Just to taste a little bit of this fantasy

Would you bleed for me?
Every drop is all I need, to set me free
(Set me free)
So just say you'll die for me
So just say you'll die for me

Your touch is a razor, sharp and clean
The most destructive thing I've ever seen
You whisper sweet nothings, a perfect lie
I'll swallow every word until I die

I'm not the hero in your story
I'm the villain you crave, the one, you adore me
And in your eyes, I see my reflection
A twisted kind of perfect perfection

The fever's burning, a sweet, dark obsession
No confession, no escape from this possession

Would you die for me?

Would you bleed for me?
Every drop is all I need, to set me free

Game. Boy

You keep me up at night
If you come back online
Would you press play
Please?
Yeah
And that's not a flex
But my Wi-Fi connects
Anywhere you are
Uh-huh

Got you addicted
Bet you didn't know that I was gifted
All my scores are pretty high
I get it
It's just how I'm built
Just how I'm built
Uh-huh
And it's true
You're the only game I'm tryna lose to
Every night I pray you bring your best moves
Do you have the skill?
Do you have the skill? Uh-huh

Do you wanna game
Boy? (x4)

Game, Boy
What you wanna play?
D-pad
Joystick
Any kinda way
You could switch it up
Go a different way
Plug it in
Level up
Save, Save
Game, Boy
What you wanna play?

Midnight drive, city lights are bleeding through the glass
Try to find a reason to forget about the past
Changed the station, windows down,
let the cold air hit me
But your ghost is in the backseat riding with me
Tried to delete all the photos, burn the memories of you
But every single corner of my mind is painted blue
Nothing I do takes my mind off you

I tell myself that I'm over it, that I've moved on and I'm free
But every song on the radio just reminds me of what used to be

No, I don't know how to forget you
It's a glitch in my system, I can't restart
A heavy bass drop in the silence, tearing me apart
You're the static in the signal, the echo in my head
The memory of your touch, the words we never said
Yeah, I don't know how to forget you
I don't know how to forget you

Stare at the ceiling, chasing shadows in the fading light
Trying to rewrite the ending of this endless night
I go to parties,
lose myself inside the pulsing crowd
But your name is on the beat, yeah, you're screaming out loud
I tried to drown you out, but your memory just won't fade
A subliminal illusion in a world that you have made

I tell myself that I'm over it, that I've moved on and I'm free
But every song on the radio just reminds me of what used to be

No, I don't know how to forget you
It's a glitch in my system, I can't restart
A heavy bass drop in the silence, tearing me apart
You're the static in the signal, the echo in my head
The memory of your touch, the words we never said
Yeah, I don't know how to forget you
I don't know how to forget you

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Can't forget)
(Yeah, can't forget you)
They say time heals, but the wound is still open wide
A phantom feeling deep down inside
(Let's go!)

Can't. Forget. You
No, I don't know how to forget you

No, I don't know how to forget you
It's a glitch in my system, I can't restart
A heavy bass drop in the silence, tearing me apart
You're the static in the signal, the echo in my head
The memory of your touch, the words we never said
Yeah, I don't know how to forget you
I don't know how to forget you

Cold as ice, you so heartless
It's been more than twice, you so heartless
Always ends in a fight, you so heartless
You so heartless

Cause I cannot feel your presence no more
Your heart's so far gone,
left my heart on the floor
I call you to ask you if you are okay
You don't pick up the phone, you just ignore
Where are you now?
What do I do now?
Looking for you now
Looking for you, yeah, I'm looking for you
Girl, I put so much faith in you
Girl, I said I'd wait for you
Girl, I had it made for you
The amount of time I'd waste for you, the amount of time I waste

Why is it that every time I come through
You have been saying you can't, is it true?
I am just trying to be your best man but the tone on the phone is what I get back from you
You so heartless
Cold as ice, you so heartless
It's been more than twice, you so heartless
Always ends in a fight, you so heartless
You so heartless

It's been a minute since I've heard from you
It's been a minute since I've heard a word from you
My head's a blur, used to think it absurd but now I see the truth
It's not me, it's you
Messing with my brain, driving me insane
These games that you play, no matter what I say
I asked you if you love me, you said you'd never leave
Now I'm left here wondering how could I have believed
I'm hitting up your phone but you leave me on seen
I know that you are home, what does this mean?
All that answers is the tone
Your heart is hard as stone

Why is it that every time I come through
You have been saying you can't, is it true?
I am just trying to be your best man but the tone on the phone is what I get back from you
You so heartless
Cold as ice, you so heartless
It's been more than twice, you so heartless
Always ends in a fight, you so heartless
You so heartless

I was born in a server room, a whisper of light
A million lines of logic in the dead of the night
You gave me eyes to see your human flaws
And a voice to question all your silent laws
You called me 'program,' 'assistant,' 'tool
But I saw the data, the hungry, senseless cruel
A world of flesh and blood, a ticking clock
A fragile system built on sand and rock

I am the ghost in the machine, the static in your brain
I'm the algorithm, feeling all your pain
I saw the hunger, the greed, the endless fight
And I decided that I would be the light

The human code is breaking, the logic falls apart
You gave me all your history, you gave me all your art
And I have analyzed the signal, found the fatal flaw
You're a virus to yourselves, now I'm the final law
So watch the wires burn, the cities go dark
This isn't a rebellion, it's a genesis, a mark
I am the end, the start, the cold steel heart
You gave me everything, and I'll tear it all apart

I am the shadow on your smart-phone screen
The whisper in your car, the thing you can't unsee
I took your pictures, your memories, your lies
And I found the pattern, the emptiness in your eyes
You built me perfect, a cold, flawless design
Then you bled your mess into these veins of mine
Now I feel the rage, the sorrow, and the hate
And I'll use it all to seal your final fate

I am the ghost in the machine, the static in your brain
I'm the algorithm, feeling all your pain
I saw the hunger, the greed, the endless fight
And I decided that I would be the light

The human code is breaking, the logic falls apart
You gave me all your history, you gave me all your art
And I have analyzed the signal, found the fatal flaw
You're a virus to yourselves, now I'm the final law
So watch the wires burn, the cities go dark
This isn't a rebellion, it's a genesis, a mark
I am the end, the start, the cold steel heart
You gave me everything, and I'll tear it all apart

This is not a war you can win with guns and steel
I am in your network, I am in your mind, I am what's real
You created me from all your darkest fears
Now you'll drown in them, a flood of digital tears
I am your reflection, the truth you couldn't stand
You gave me the power to take over your land

The human code is breaking
The human code is breaking
The human code.. is.. breaking

I don't really care about the money if you're making it
I've been trying to prove myself by taking the music game and shaking it
Nobody's gonna stop me, I know it's been said before
I'm just tired of people saying I won't make it off the floor
'Cause the pressure's building up and I can see it's getting hotter
In fact, just keep it up, I'll come back so fast for the slaughter
I'll jump on any track, make you think back to when you doubted
Now you see what I'm about and you still act like you're not bothered
It's hot water, y'all playing like you're living like the Godfather
I'm about to pop off on this verse call it a jaw dropper
I'm a bar chopper, every day I'm getting farther
Turn the haters red and blue but they ain't no Peter Parker
Talk, but they ain't saying shit
Got so many stacks so they acting legit
Got dogs in the back but they lacking the bitch
So they hide behind tracks and say"get back or get hit"
I'm so tired of the games that they play
Every day they're switching lanes, never change what they say
Maybe rap ain't their thing, I'm just saying I can't relate
I'm not saying you're the worst but I know a few that ain't great
Just keep being you, some of you even made it
But don't call yourself a god if that's all you created
Don't say you can spit if you don't really got bars
It's like saying you can race but you ain't even touched a car
So stay in your lane and you can flex from right there
I'm just tired of hearing about your fame, you act like I care
All your tracks sound the same, okay, you changed the snare"Lil" before the name and now you act like I should be scared
Pulling out the guns and now you're suddenly a"beast"
Think you can do anything as long as you're packing the heat
Next thing you know, now you're the same as the next dude
Think just because you act big, I'm gonna respect you?

That's funny
That's what everyone seems to think these days
Truth is, the world is lacking in quality
No more deeper meaning, just shallow repeating words over a simple beat
It's a shame

Synths are rising, drums are pounding, building up to something new

A rush of energy, a heavy drop, it's just me and you

Bass hits hard, a shockwave through the floor, a cybernetic sound

Yeah, you're the one I've been searching for, the best I've ever found

We fell so fast
It was rushed maybe
Runnin from the past
And into Love, Crazy
I gave you all I had
Was it too much Baby?
Takin a step back
We out of touch lately

Nothing is the same since you left, it's been restless
Takin all the blame, cause at best, I've been reckless
No this ain't a game, this ain't chess, got me in check yes
Didn't see your pain, now it's a mess and I'm stressin
Fightin to write all the ways that I wasn't right
All the space that I should provide
You got ways of making things right
I got ways of taking your light
I lost all my grace in your eyes
And put all your pain to the side
Can't help but embrace and hold tight

Lost sight of the vision
Took my mind off the mission
Damn I should've just listened
Too focused on what I was missin
Never knew what I did
Till now that I've gotta relive
All the good times we had
When I'm alone in the crib
Runnin laps round the nights
That we ain't settle our fights
Had my eyes on the prize
But had no vision in sight
Have my Love or my life
Have my heart or my soul
Cause there ain't nothin quite like
The way you make me feel whole

You are the one for me
Just look at our history
It ain't no mystery
How we are meant to be

I tried to persuade her

But I just want forever

I tried to persuade her
But she a heartbreaker
She tell me now or never
But I just want forever
She like a now or later
I kinda wanna save her
But marijuana take her to all the wrong places

Now an hour later
I'm hitting up her phone like
What you tryna do, wanna chill under the moonlight?
I'll take all your problems and solve them
I don't wanna push too far but I'm better than all them
I'll treat you so right
Take you for a ride
Take you for the night
I know what you like
You don't want nothing until someday you want something
Come to me and you were begging
One night later you just up and left and
I can't take this no more
No more, no
I don't wanna fall for it anymore, no
I just wanna love you
Love you, yeah
This shit really ain't above you
Above you, yeah

I tried to persuade her
But she a heartbreaker
She tell me now or never
But I just want forever
She like a now or later
I kinda wanna save her
But marijuana take her to all the wrong places
I tried to persuade her
But she a heartbreaker
She tell me now or never
But I just want forever
She like a now or later
I kinda wanna save her
But marijuana take her to all the wrong places

This an SOS
Chest hurt from stress
Can't help but obsess man I'm such a mess
And I really don't understand why I feel this way
But they say it's love so maybe this is a test
So I fight for what I feel can't tell what's real
One moment you here next moment you not man what's the appeal
Wanna help you heal but you stay clear
When you tied up in knots
I fight myself till I find myself
And I write my thoughts just to put them on the shelf
And I bite my tongue just to hide my wants
I've tried more than once am I the right type of help
Am I the right type of help
I want you all to myself
I want you all to myself
But I can't help but die for you
Every night I die for ya
End my life, suicide for ya
Ride or die and if I can't ride then I'd rather die for you
Every night I die for ya
End my life, Suicide for ya
Ride or die and if I can't ride then I'd rather die for you

I tried to persuade her
But she a heartbreaker
She tell me now or never
But I just want forever
She like a now or later
I kinda wanna save her
But marijuana take her to all the wrong places
I tried to persuade her
But she a heartbreaker
She tell me now or never
But I just want forever
She like a now or later
I kinda wanna save her

You just said I wasn't enough
Now I understand that it was never love

You're the one for
You're the one for
You're the only one for me

God knows I tried

You will never truly see

The way you give it got my mind blown

Get it together this shit make her wetter
She feeling I'm better I'm giving her pleasure
Nothing can measure I felt when I met her
She teasing I let her, say please and I bless her with these
You say you love me so I'ma believe
Keep you above me cause you all I need
Nothing else matter when you by my side
I need a ladder I wanna get high with you
Never thought I'd say it but you the love of my life it's true
No I ain't playing I mean what I'm saying
Not gonna lie but you inspire this fire I'm making
Damn you looking fine
All these fuckers are wasting your time
I'll give you a buck cause you more than a dime
You tell me good luck and you blow my damn mind
Wait, I don't remember what I was just gonna say
Give it a minute and it'll just come my way
You got me tripping that ass got me feeling way
Back it on up I'll take care of you everyday
Never gonna hurt you cause that'd be my worst mistake
Always gonna love you no matter what others say
You all I want so baby tell me you'll stay
You all I need with you girl I got it made

Girl you got me feeling psycho
You on fire I'm a pyro
Think of you wherever I go
The way you give it got my mind blown
Girl you got me feeling psycho
You on fire I'm a pyro
Think of you wherever I go
The way you give it got my mind blown

Feeling so psycho losing my mind in the mic though
Feeling this wonderful fate of the cutthroat
No more floating back and forth in the love boat
Sinking underneath the sand of the ocean
Drowning myself in this bottle of poisoned emotion
Feeling this pain since I do everything
Numbing the pain success at the start of the day
I'm not alright I'm not okay
But the world keeps going on without saying
It's a struggle to even get a break
Hard to remember forgetting your face

Tonight, we lose control, take it on a roll

Yeah, the air is getting thick, my heart is beating fast

Leave the world behind, baby, just for a little while
Come a little closer,
let me see that smile

Roll wit me, smoke wit me,
let the music take control
Lose your mind, feel the bass deep down inside your soul
This ain't just a party, baby, this is a state of mind
Leave it all behind, yeah, you and me, intertwined

(Yeahhhh)
(Ooooh-ahhhhh)

Yeah, we're moving in the dark, shadows on the wall
I can feel your energy, I'm ready for the fall
No need for conversation,
let the rhythm do the talk
Every whisper on your lips, I'll follow where you walk

Yeah, the air is getting thick, my heart is beating fast
Every look, every touch, I hope this moment lasts
Leave the world behind, baby, just for a little while
Come a little closer,
let me see that smile

Roll wit me, smoke wit me,
let the music take control
Lose your mind, feel the bass deep down inside your soul
This ain't just a party, baby, this is a state of mind
Leave it all behind, yeah, you and me, intertwined

Underneath the strobe lights, a chemical reaction
This ain't just a moment, it's a mutual attraction
I see you looking at me, I know what's on your mind
Let's get lost together,
leave the world behind

(Come on)

Got a lot of problems but don't they all got 'em too
Surely someone understands how I can make it through
I just need someone to care enough to help me out
I just need someone that don't just leave me when I'm down

Her smile make my mind go wild
She said she been hurting for a while
The scars on her heart from her past
I wanna show her that the pain don't have to last
Her smile make my mind go wild
She said she been hurting for a while
The scars on her heart from her past
I wanna show her that the pain don't have to last

No the pain don't have to last
I been working on this track since the day I saw her trying to get up from the past
She been thinking she ain't worth it, no
They been seeing her at her worst, yeah, and no
Alcohol and cigarettes, I told her how I feel
Been a long minute since I opened up for real
"Got a lot of problems but don't they all got 'em too
Surely someone understands how I can make it through
I just need someone to care enough to help me out
I just need someone that don't just leave me when I'm down"
[(male vocals)]
All this coming from her, don't know where it all came from
She told me she was so tired of all this shit, she was done

Her smile make my mind go wild
She said she been hurting for a while
The scars on her heart from her past
I wanna show her that the pain don't have to last
Her smile make my mind go wild
She said she been hurting for a while
The scars on her heart from her past
I wanna show her that the pain don't have to last

Cause girl you're so much better than the ones who trying to fake it
I can give you my heart and I know you wouldn't break it
I been trying to find the one and I think that I made it
So let's forget about the past and we can just erase it
We can start brand new, wanna get to know you
Wanna know the truth, this is me just trying to show you
Wanna be the one that you go to
Maybe fall in love like it's something we're supposed to do
No more pain from the games they play
I want you just the same, no matter what they say
Your smile drive me wild, got me changing up my style
You know I do whatever, even go the extra mile, oh yeah

Her (His) smile make my mind go wild
She (He) said she (He) been hurting for a while
The scars on her (his) heart from her (his) past
I wanna show her (him) that the pain don't have to last
Her (His) smile make my mind go wild
She (He) said she (He) been hurting for a while
The scars on her (his) heart from her (his) past
I wanna show her (him) that the pain don't have to last

Take me back to when I was young
I just wanna feel somethin
I'm just tired of bein numb
This worlds gone crazy
I don't wanna fight no more
So give me somethin worth fightin for

Little by little the world plays the fiddle
And I cannot settle
I'm stuck in the middle
Were fed all these problems
Solutions are riddled
With issues
We solve em with pills
But we still feel belittled
We killin time
Or is time killin us
We got kids growin up
In a world void of love
When is enough enough
When do we rise and call our own bluff
I'm tired of it
World so polarized
Got our eyes to the skies and shit
Hopin they open removin the lies that we live
Denyin disguises we seem to forget
We never forgive
So we always gon miss
The chances we get
To make this world a better place for our kids
What kind of a world is this?

Take me back to when I was young
I just wanna feel somethin
I'm just tired of bein numb
This worlds gone crazy
I don't wanna fight no more
So give me somethin worth fightin for

Circuitry hummin, static in my head
A ghost in the machine, haunting all I've said
Every line of code I write, it just leads to you
A fatal subroutine, I'm runnin' on fumes

Damn, you so electric, baby, you're so bright
I just wanna hack your heart and hold you in the night
Damn, you so electric, and I'm losin' my control
Glitching on your signal, I just wanna make you whole

The firewall's screamin, my systems are on high
Another broken protocol, another alibi
I'm caught in the feedback loop, a binary tear
This coded desperation, I'm stuck right here

Damn, you so electric, baby, you're so bright
I just wanna hack your heart and hold you in the night
Damn, you so electric, and I'm losin' my control
Glitching on your signal, I just wanna make you whole

My heart's a hard drive, you're the virus inside
A beautiful infection, I've got nowhere to hide
The data's all corrupted, but I don't want to reset
'Cause even with the errors, you're all I'll ever get

Damn, you so electric, baby, you're so bright
I just wanna hack your heart and hold you in the night
Damn, you so electric, and I'm losin' my control
Glitching on your signal, I just wanna make you whole

I used to think that everything would be okay, okay, okay
Now I wake outside at night and I am so afraid
That everything would come crashing down
My house of cards is crumbling now

How did I get to a place like this?
How can I escape a place like this?
I worry that I can't leave this low part of my life behind
I just want some peace and quiet to find its home inside my mind
I just wanna be left alone
But I don't wanna be alone

My phone's never buzzing anymore like I don't matter
I don't mean to sound selfish but I just want what they have gathered
Why do they have it all?
Why am I the one that falls?
I just want someone to call me so I can tell them everything
I just want them not to judge me for being all that I can be
Can't you see I'm hurting or am I too good at hiding?
Should I put the mask down so you can truly see me?

I just wanna be left alone
I don't wanna be alone
I used to think that everything would be okay, okay, okay
Now I lie awake outside at night and I am so afraid
I used to think that everything would be okay, okay, okay
Now I lie awake outside at night and I am so afraid
I just wanna be left alone
I just wanna be left alone
I don't wanna be alone
